import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Print column names to identify the correct one for species
print("Columns in the dataframe:")
print(df.columns)

# Assuming the column name for species is 'Species' (common in Iris datasets),
# but this will be confirmed by the output of the above print statement.
# Once confirmed, the next step would be to re-run with the correct column name.
# For now, I'll print columns and wait for the output to confirm.
